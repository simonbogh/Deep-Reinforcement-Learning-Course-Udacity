# Project 1 - Navigation with a DQN agent
This folder contains the solution to project 1 on navigation for the Udacity Nanodegree.

In this project an agent is trained to collect yellow bananas (+1) while avoiding blue bananas (-1) in a 3D world. The goal of the agent is to maximize its reward by collecting as many yellow bananas as possible during one episode.

The Unity ML-Agents environment is employed for the training environment. The simulation contains a single agent that navigates a large environment.

The state-space has 37 dimensions containing the agent's velocity and distance measurements in front of the agent. Based on this information, the agent learns how to apply four actions:
* 0: move forward.
* 1: move backward.
* 2: turn left.
* 3: turn right.

The reward function is based on providing +1 for a yellow banana, and -1 for a blue banana.

The task is episodic, and the environment is considered solved when the agent gets an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

The solution employs a Deep Q-Network (DQN) and learns to collect an average score of more than +13 after 280 episodes, but performance improves up to around 900 episodes.
